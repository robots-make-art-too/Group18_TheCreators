# Group Discussion / `(PHASE 2)`


Our group has had a discussion about what we did for Phase 2 and the futrure of what we will do and the plans we have for the project. Each group member has played,
and had a chance to experience and try out the AR, server hosting and trial, and QR scanning. We have agreeded to constently become more familiar and play around more
with these type of things to get a better view and become more comfortable with it as phase 3 would be more advanced. We all have our strenghts for the parts and 
are willing to learn, as Halima is good with the art based side and works very well with 3D, The rest of the group members can work well with figuring out the AR,
Scanning, QR code, markers and etc.. We have all had the ability to work threw this up to a point and will continue to do so.
