GROUP DISCUSSION


Our group has had a discussion about what we did for phase 2 and the futrure of what we will do and the plans we have for the project. Each group member has played,
and had a chance to experience and try out the AR, server hosting and trial, and QR scanning. We have agreeded to constently become more familiar and play around more
with these type of things to get a better view and become more comfortable with it.
