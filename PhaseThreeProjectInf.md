# Group 18â€™s Phase Three Project Information

## Group Members And Contribution: 

`Zeeshan Baig:` Helped with making the markers and the QR code and displaying the code throughout the project for phase 2 and 3. Was more involved in the code aspect and helping organize. 

`Delvin Salman:` Helping out with the code aspects and fixing some things for phase 2 and 3. Also more involved with helping organize and coming up with ideas such as theme, website attributes etc. 

`Halima Dairo:` Helped out on the models, making many of her own. Also helped out much with giving ideas based on model ideas such as the garden and nature theme we have chosen. 

`Mengyao Fan:` Created the markers for phase 3 so they could be printed, and helped out phase 3 idea of what to create.

`Taibah Radwan:` Was not involved in the coding, models and marker creation, and/or ideation stage of the project. When asked to help, the member was non-responsive.

 ## Think of this PDF document as the detailed and comprehensive `README.md` and `STATEMENT.md` files combined: 

In our project, as a group we decided that our idea to represent in AR with 3D models was a virtual garden that can be shown through markers indoors or outdoors. Our group found many models and objects that fit our chosen theme. In addition, we create a few of our own to add a more personal touch to our virtual garden. In terms of code interaction, we implemented a way in which the markers can change and move in relation to the markers. Our project also includes a wide variety of models in order to use the best to the best we can and fill it out like a real garden. The many varieties of models are just another enhancement to the overall user experience. Our goal for this project was to allow the user to simply scan a QR code, navigate through the website and allow it to access the camera module on their phone. Next, the user would be able to point their camera at the marker and watch as the models come alive on their phone in AR. The viewer would then be able to walk in and around the model and point at other models and simulate what it would look like to be in a garden. Our group wanted to transport the user to a new environment through AR and help them bring a little bit of nature into their vastly urban world. In cities such as Toronto and other places around the world, a lack of green space is becoming a concern and while this is not a replacement for actual green space, our AR concept hopes to bring some into the lives of any user around the world.
