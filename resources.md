### Aesthetic

The following are just images of art that I think would be cool to show off if we wanted to actually create a digital gallery.

<br>Other Aestheic components
4. https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions – I really like the met so could be nice to create a mini gallery of things and let the user pic what to see instead of just one thing.
5. https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fdc7339-8fee-43df-8ec3-efae02b9f152/7-ar-experience.png – I am not sure if I am going out of scope here but I do like the idea of a very clean UI. This seems out of scope though so will need to think about what is expected of us.

### Technical
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GmJLI122ZM – This is a quick QR code in python...maybe we can use this someway if we want to represent our art through QR codes.
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5AW9qpOkU4 – This is how to make AR snapchat filters but these have no coding required. Maybe we can find a version that includes coding?
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE – One of my goals through this project is to learn Git and really understand it so here is a video going through the main things in 15 min.
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIXJJoqM8BQ – AR JavaScript web app?
5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPfODr2e5Xw – Goggle Chrome Developers going through talking about 3D, VR, and AR on the web and their WebXR APIs.
