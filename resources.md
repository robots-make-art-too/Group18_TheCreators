### Technical
Here is another 5, of the techincal aspect of this in which i think can be helpfull as well when developing a project based of code.

1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgTwkTP6PM / Going thew how art can help with code and the image that is set by it. 2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U / Also another video on the code of art, and how code can tell storys.
3.https://anna-carey.medium.com/the-art-of-code-236421a043a / How art is code, and the importance it servers. 4.https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/ / Learning code in any form of it, would be helpfull. 5.https://hourofcode.com/ca/learn / Place to look if one need to understand code more.

// All these links can be a factor to consider when doing this porject in many ways, beacuse there is so much to choose from that why it is important to do something that i feel, repersents you, shows a meaning, and creates something thats means something in terms of its value and worth in the world.

### Aesthetic

The following are just images of art that I think would be cool to show off if we wanted to actually create a digital gallery.

2. https://cdn.britannica.com/78/43678-050-F4DC8D93/Starry-Night-canvas-Vincent-van-Gogh-New-1889.jpg

<br>Other Aesthetic components
4. https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions – I really like the met so could be nice to create a mini gallery of things and let the user pick what to see instead of just one thing.
5. https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fdc7339-8fee-43df-8ec3-efae02b9f152/7-ar-experience.png – I am not sure if I am going out of scope here but I do like the idea of a very clean UI. This seems out of scope though so will need to think about what is expected of us.

### Technical
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GmJLI122ZM – This is a quick QR code in python...maybe we can use this someway if we want to represent our art through QR codes.
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5AW9qpOkU4 – This is how to make AR snapchat filters but these have no coding required. Maybe we can find a version that includes coding?
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE – One of my goals through this project is to learn Git and really understand it so here is a video going through the main things in 15 min.
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIXJJoqM8BQ – AR JavaScript web app?
5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPfODr2e5Xw – Goggle Chrome Developers going through talking about 3D, VR, and AR on the web and their WebXR APIs.
