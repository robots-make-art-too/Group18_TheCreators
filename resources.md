### Technical
Here is another 5, of the techincal aspect of this in which i think can be helpfull as well when developing a project based of code.

1.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgTwkTP6PM / Going thew how art can help with code and the image that is set by it. 
<br>
2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U / Also another video on the code of art, and how code can tell storys.
<br>
3.https://anna-carey.medium.com/the-art-of-code-236421a043a / How art is code, and the importance it servers. 
<br>
4.https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/ / Learning code in any form of it, would be helpfull. 
<br>
5.https://hourofcode.com/ca/learn / Place to look if one need to understand code more.

// All these links can be a factor to consider when doing this porject in many ways, beacuse there is so much to choose from that why it is important to do something that i feel, repersents you, shows a meaning, and creates something thats means something in terms of its value and worth in the world.

<b> Aesthetics </b> <br>

I have chosen these five pieces cause they represent a level of futurism I would really like to input.

<b> Technical<b> <br>

Here are couple of things I believe would be really helpful 

1. https://www.shiftr.io/ - We can use this (if we learn how to properly) to work on an interconnected part of our project, getting live updates.

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEBOTRboXBE&t=2s - This is video is on an art coding techinic which I find amazing as it implements 3d and pixels 

3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Xdi1tZnOI - This is a method of pixelating a video 

4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Xdi1tZnOI - Incase we decide to use python 

5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8hqLh_HE08 - 3d (blender) generative art created using lines of code

### Aesthetic

The following are just images of art that I think would be cool to show off if we wanted to actually create a digital gallery.
1. https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/michelangelo-david-statue-thumbnail.jpg
2. https://cdn.britannica.com/78/43678-050-F4DC8D93/Starry-Night-canvas-Vincent-van-Gogh-New-1889.jpg
3. https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1069947/177637-web.jpg <br>
<br>Other Aesthetic components
4. https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions – I really like the met so could be nice to create a mini gallery of things and let the user pick what to see instead of just one thing.
5. https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fdc7339-8fee-43df-8ec3-efae02b9f152/7-ar-experience.png – I am not sure if I am going out of scope here but I do like the idea of a very clean UI. This seems out of scope though so will need to think about what is expected of us.

### Technical
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GmJLI122ZM – This is a quick QR code in python...maybe we can use this someway if we want to represent our art through QR codes.
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5AW9qpOkU4 – This is how to make AR snapchat filters but these have no coding required. Maybe we can find a version that includes coding?
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE – One of my goals through this project is to learn Git and really understand it so here is a video going through the main things in 15 min.
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIXJJoqM8BQ – AR JavaScript web app?
5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPfODr2e5Xw – Goggle Chrome Developers going through talking about 3D, VR, and AR on the web and their WebXR APIs.

## Discussion

Our group discussed that we will all include our links and resources and then review the different assets, inspirations, and links and discuss further in our discord group. We like the idea of using art and potentially creating our own through different ways of coding. How to display this art is a topic of discussion.
