<b> Technical<b> <br>

Here are couple of things I believe would be really helpful 

1. https://www.shiftr.io/ - We can use this (if we learn how to properly) to work on an interconnected part of our project, getting live updates.

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEBOTRboXBE&t=2s - This is video is on an art coding techinic which I find amazing as it implements 3d and pixels 

3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Xdi1tZnOI - This is a method of pixelating a video 

4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Xdi1tZnOI - Incase we decide to use python 

5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8hqLh_HE08 - 3d (blender) generative art created using lines of code
